                <P>Looking for a quick and easy way to learn flutenotes for beginners? You’ve found the quintessential guide on how to read music notes for flute.
                </P>
                
                <p>As you start to become more familiar with the flute, you’ll naturally become interested in learning more note positions. Every new player has a goal of learning all of the flute notes, no matter what style of flute they’re looking to play.It’s important to learn how to read music notes for flute as soon as you can—the sooner you learn them, the sooner you can read sheet music and master different melodies.Learning flute notes can also help you improve on specific elements of your technique that are crucial to getting off to a good start. You’ll start to see your posture, the way you hold the flute, and your embouchure all improve with practice.Speaking of posture, there are a few key things you should remember to help you learn how to play flute notes comfortably. First, let your fingers curve over the top of your keys using the least amount of tension, without feeling like you’ll drop the flute.Don’t try to grip the keys or put your fingertip right on the key. Instead, let your whole hand hold the flute, and remember that your fingertip is simply an extension of your finger that originates near the wrist. Proceed slowly, and try to eliminate any unnecessary tensions as you play.As you learn the flute for beginners basics, try to release and relax your elbows and shoulders, which are two areas that often try to “help” as you play. Lastly, learn to keep your fingers close to the keys—don’t let them fly away with each change of note! This is referred to as “economy of motion.

                    <p>Control the keys closest to the head joint with your left hand. Locate the first key on the bottom of the body of your flute and rest your thumb on it so your palm faces you. Wrap the rest of your fingers around the other side of the flute. Put your index, middle, and ring fingers on the 2nd, 4th, and 5th keys respectively. Rest your pinky on the side key that looks like a paddle.</p>

Make sure your palm faces away from you so you can easily press the keys. Locate the bottom 3 keys on the main body of your flute. Put your index, middle, and ring fingers on each of the keys. Use your right pinky to press the first key on the foot joint.</p></div>

Keep your arms relaxed and away from your body as you raise the flute to your mouth. Make sure the flute is parallel to the ground rather than angling it down.</p>

                    <p>Position the hole underneath the center of your bottom lip. While you’re holding the flute parallel to the floor, set the lip plate underneath your bottom lip. Balance the flute between your chin and bottom lip for the most support. Make sure the hole is directly in the center of your lips to achieve the best tone.</p>

                    <h2>2</h2>
                    <p>Tighten the corners of your mouth while keeping your lips smooth and relaxed. Firm up the muscles in the corners of your mouth, but not so tightly that your lips are wrinkled or pursed. Pretend that you’re saying the letter “M” to get the right lip posture, or embouchure.</p></div>

                    <h2>3</h2>
                    <p>Blow air from the middle of your lips toward the hole. Slightly open your mouth like you’re about to say the letter “P” to blow air into the instrument. Exhale a deep breath in a controlled stream toward the hole to play the flute. The air will travel through the body of the flute and create notes.</p>

                    <h2>4</h2>
                    <p>Move your tongue back and forth to make short notes. While you’re playing your flute, move your tongue like you’re saying the word “too.” This will help separate the notes you’re playing from one another rather than them sounding like they’re gliding together. Alternate moving your tongue faster and slower to transition between a quick series of short notes and longer, separate notes.</p>

                    <h2>5</h2>
                    <p>Change the speed of your breath to adjust the pitch of your note. Take a deep breath and exhale slowly across the hole on your flute to hit notes in a lower register. Then with your next breath, tighten the corners of your mouth slightly more and exhale quickly to make a higher-pitched note. Practice alternating between high and low notes so you can develop better range while you play.</p></div>

                    <h2>6</h2>
                    <p>Look at a fingering chart to learn how to play different notes. Fingering charts can help you learn how to play through the notes in a scale. Look for a fingering chart for the type of flute you have so you can see which keys you need to press for each note. Work through each fingering while you play so you can easily change between the notes.</p>
